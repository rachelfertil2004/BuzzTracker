## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Hype Score Algorithm**
```javascript
const normalizedPopularity = Math.min(popularity / 100, 1) * 100;
const normalizedRating = (vote_average / 10) * 100;
const hypeScore = (normalizedPopularity * 0.6) + (normalizedRating * 0.4);
```

**Weighting:**
- 60% TMDb Popularity (buzz/visibility)
- 40% Vote Average (quality signal)

### **State Management**
```javascript
const [title1, setTitle1] = useState(null);
const [title2, setTitle2] = useState(null);
const [loading1, setLoading1] = useState(false);
const [loading2, setLoading2] = useState(false);
const [showComparison, setShowComparison] = useState(false);
```

Independent state for each title allows:
- Async loading
- Single-title analysis
